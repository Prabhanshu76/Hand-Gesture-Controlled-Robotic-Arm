# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Robotic-Arm

-The project required interfacing of Arduino Uno with Servo motors, Flex Sensor and accelerometer.

-The idea is to use motion and bend sensors to detect  hand movements by placing them on a glove.

-The values from sensors are mapped to produce required output from servos to produce movement of robotic arm.
